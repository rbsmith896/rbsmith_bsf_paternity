# Simulating Multiple Paternity in Black Soldier Flies

RB Smith's 2023 Summer MSc Project

This code creates a simulation that models experiments for detecting multiple paternity in Black Soldier Fly clutches.
The scripts `MP_DetectionPower.R` and `PoolSequencing_MPDetection.R` are complete, with explanations and instructions on
using them in the scripts' comments. The former simulates an individual sequencing method, while the latter simulates
a pool sequencing method. The rest are incomplete scripts committed to the repo while building the simulation.

Files with the prefix "_OLD" are interim scripts created during simulation development.

Files with the prefix "_COMP" are composite scripts containing all the code used to generate the data and figures in my
MSc report - these scripts were divided into smaller chunks to run on the Eddie servers.
